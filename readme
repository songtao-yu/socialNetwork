####procedure####
1. construct the graph people object with the input file(SocialNetwork.txt)
2. initialize two containers
   1) m_nameDictionary: make the map between person name and one unique number
   2) m_friendMatrix: we can take it to be one matrix, in which the header of each line is
      one person(representing with the number in m_nameDictionary) and the remainings of the
      line are the direct friends(also with the number in m_nameDictionary).
   3) FYI - we look through the input file one time to construct the two contains.
3. determine the total number with the function "getPeopleNumber()"
   1) if the end user doesn't call the function "initializeFirendList()" ahead, error
      will be reprted out.
4. determine the distance between two persons with the function "getFriendDistance()"
   1) The basic idea in the function comes from "Dijkstra's algorithm" as below link:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
   2) I made some improvements in case that the shortest path among two persons has
      been found before traversing the whole graph matrix. Please see the lines from
      156 to 160 for the detailed.

####misc####
1. The development tool I used is QT Creator with the MinGW (32 bit) in windows 7. 
2. I am attaching two version. One is for release and the other is for debugging
3. The output of my APP is as below:
   Total number of people is: 82168
   The distance between STACEY_STRIMPLE and RICH_OMLI is: 4
